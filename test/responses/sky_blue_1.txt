The sky is blue because Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight. White sunlight is
made up of different colors, each with its own wavelength. The tiny gas molecules
in the atmosphere scatter the shorter, blue wavelengths of light more effectively
than the longer, red wavelengths. This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering.
